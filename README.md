# Fashion Image Recommendation Model for Natural Language Search Queries

This project aims to address the limitations of existing online shopping platforms by implementing a  fashion image recommendation model designed to handle natural language queries for image-text retrieval. The proposed solution utilizes the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset (Jiang et al., 2022) for training and testing. The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model (Radford et al., 2021) was selected as the baseline for this study, and several methods were explored to enhance its performance. The table below shows the results for the baseline and improved models.
